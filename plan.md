## 1. Set Up the Project

- Create a new directory for the project: `mkdir task-tracker-cli`
- Initialize a new repository: `git init`
- Create a new README.md file to document the project: `touch README.md`
- Choose a programming language to build the application.

## 2. Design the Data Model

- Define the structure of a task object based on the provided task properties.
- Determine the format for storing tasks in the JSON file.

## 3. Implement the CLI Interface

- Use the built-in command line argument parsing functionality of the chosen programming language.
- Define the commands and their arguments based on the usage examples provided.

## 4. Implement Task Management Functions

- Implement a function to add a new task to the JSON file.
- Implement a function to update an existing task in the JSON file.
- Implement a function to delete a task from the JSON file.
- Implement a function to mark a task as 'in progress' or 'done' in the JSON file.

## 5. Implement Task Listing Functions

- Implement a function to list all tasks from the JSON file.
- Implement a function to list tasks based on their status (done, todo, in progress) from the JSON file.

## 6. Implement JSON File Interaction

- Use the native file system module of the chosen programming language to read from and write to the JSON file.
- Implement a function to load tasks from the JSON file when the application starts.
- Implement a function to save tasks to the JSON file whenever a task is added, updated, deleted, or marked as 'in progress' or 'done'.

## 7. Handle Errors and Edge Cases

- Implement error handling mechanisms to handle file I/O errors, JSON parsing errors, and missing or invalid arguments.

## 8. Test the Application

- Test the application with various inputs, including edge cases, to ensure that it behaves as expected.

## 9. Document the Application

- Document the application's usage and API in the README.md file.
- Include examples of how to use the application, as well as any limitations or known issues.

## 10. Version Control and Deployment

- Commit the initial version of the application to the repository.
- Set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, if desired.

## 11. Maintenance and Future Development

- Monitor the application for performance issues and bugs.
- Address any issues that are reported by users.
- Consider adding new features or enhancements to the application, such as the ability to filter tasks by date, set due dates, or assign tasks to users.
